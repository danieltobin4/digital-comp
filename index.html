<!--Hello digital composer! Welcome to my Project Reflection web design tool, powered by Stasis Theory. I'm glad you found it--we're going to adapt a 2,000 year-old formula to help you pitch an idea, explaining who you are, what you want, why it's important, and what it will do for your audience. I use this program with my students and interns at the University of Pittsburgh to help them strategically package the work they have accomplished in their project/internship/teaching assistantship. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web document that helps you process your experience, and through the process, you'll learn a little bit about coding.

BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design. They are here to help you through the making process. Once you have finished editing, follow the directions on the repository ReadMe to learn how to publish your webtext to GitHub.-->

<!--Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document from "Project Name" to whatever you want. The "META" information below the title does important work to help tell different browsers what this page should look like on different screens like cell phones or desktops. The link connects this HTML document to the style.css--we'll talk more about this in the next step.-->

<title>Project Name</title>

<!--Replace the project title and provide a flashy subtitle. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block." You don't need to do anything in this html. code, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. First replace the el1.jpg with a .jpg or .png in the project folder (hint: simplify the name). Then use your text editor to open your style.css sheet, find the hero image, and replace p1.jpg with the name of your new image-->

<!--Add more images to your project folder for a photo grid, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add to the names on the grid below on this html file. You can add more images if you wish, or subtract...see what happens--you have to be playful to find out how things work. You will want to resize large images that will take too long to upload--at the same time you don't want them pixilated. Around 1200px wide should work well. It's also essential that you add ALT TEXT to describe your images for users with a wide range of disabilities.-->

    <h1>Technical</h1>

    <h2>This project was completed using Final Cut and Logic Pro X. The music was composed on Logic Pro X with a midi keyboard and an audio interface for guitar. It was then paired with the footage in Logic Pro. The goal was to highlight the effect that humans do to our Earth and its environments.

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h1>Impact</h1>
     <h2>This project was made due to my anxiety about the future of our planet and civilizations. With the growing change in the climate and the seemingly little regard to stop that, I wanted to find a way to put that into a piece of media. I hope that it has the same feeling that I feel about the issue and helps the audience experience it as well.</h2>

  <h1>Moving Forward</h1>

    <h2>During the making of this project it helped me learn more about filmmaking because that is not normally a field that I am experienced in. I learned about shots and different editting skills and hope to further that knowledge in the future by taking on more projects that push that knowledge. I also hope to get more experience making music for videos. That was something that I had never done before and found quite difficult. There was a lot of starting over and scratching of ideas because it was difficult to correctly express a video through music. I think it is somehting that I will definitely experiment with more in the future.</h2>
